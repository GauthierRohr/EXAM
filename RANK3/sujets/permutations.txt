Write a program that takes a string as argument and prints all its unique
permutations in lexicographical order, one per line.

- The program must handle strings with repeated characters.
- You must sort the characters of the string before generating permutations.
- You must generate exactly n! permutations, where n is the length of the string.
- If the number of arguments is not 1, the program should return 1 without printing anything.

Examples:

$> ./permutations "abc"
abc
acb
bac
bca
cab
cba

$> ./permutations "aab"
aab
aba
baa

$> ./permutations "ab"
ab
ba

$> ./permutations "a"
a

$> ./permutations "aa"
aa
