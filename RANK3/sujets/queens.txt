--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Write a program that takes a single positive integer n as argument and solves
the n-queens problem: placing n queens on an n√ón chessboard so that no two
queens threaten each other.

- Each solution must be printed on a single line as a sequence of numbers
  separated by spaces, representing the row indices (0-based) of the queen in
  each column.

- If there are multiple solutions, print them all, each on a new line.
- If the number of arguments is not 1, or if n <= 0, the program should return 1.

Examples:

$> ./queens 4
1 3 0 2
2 0 3 1

$> ./queens 1
0

$> ./queens 2
(no output)

$> ./queens 3
(no output)
