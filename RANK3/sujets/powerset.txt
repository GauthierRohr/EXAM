Write a program that takes a target sum as the first argument and a list of
integers as the following arguments. It must print all unique subsets of the
given set of integers whose sum is equal to the target. Each subset must be
printed as space-separated numbers on a single line.

- Each number must be printed only once per subset.
- If there is no solution, the program should print nothing.
- If the number of arguments is less than 2, the program should return 1.

Examples:

$> ./powerset 5 1 2 3
2 3

$> ./powerset 7 2 4 6
(no output)

$> ./powerset 10 2 3 5 7
2 3 5
3 7

$> ./powerset 8 8
8
